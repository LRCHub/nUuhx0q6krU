[00:21.95] For the first time, I would like my name
[00:26.13] Just because of the way you say it
[00:31.14] And I would memorize every line and hair
[00:35.70] To remember when you aren't there
[00:52.20] 
[00:40.98] We would walk along a tree-lined street
[00:45.24] With a breeze dancing at our feet
[00:50.59] We would sing a song in harmony
[00:54.93] If only you hadn't left me
[01:07.93] 
[01:02.48] So I'll think of you once in a moon
[01:07.31] When I hear your favorite tune
[01:12.16] And someday, after a year or two
[01:16.95] Maybe then I won't be loving you
[01:21.77] I'll think of you once in a moon
[01:26.52] When I see someone who looks like you
[01:31.35] And someday, after a year or two
[01:36.13] Maybe then I'll still be loving you
[01:53.63] 
[01:46.22] We would say goodbye just to say hello again
[01:50.54] And we would get in fights just to get over them
[01:55.80] We would be alright even if things don't stay the same
[02:00.20] If only you had stayed
[02:11.20] 
[02:07.41] So I'll think of you once in a moon
[02:12.52] When I hear your favorite tune
[02:17.33] And someday, after a year or two
[02:22.19] Maybe then I won't be loving you
[02:26.88] I'll think of you once in a moon
[02:31.77] When I see someone who looks like you
[02:36.55] And someday, after a year or two
[02:41.31] Maybe then I'll still be loving you
[02:58.81] 
[02:47.63] What if I had bit my tongue?
[02:51.24] What if what we had was enough?
[02:55.96] I guess all my calculations were off
[03:00.49] When I thought I would get over you
[03:07.98] It doesn't make sense
[03:12.40] But I'd do it all again
[03:23.90] 
[03:18.19] I'll think of you once in a moon
[03:23.36] When I hear your favorite tune
[03:28.04] And someday, after a year or two
[03:32.99] Maybe then I won't be loving you
[03:37.69] I'll think of you once in a moon
[03:42.53] When I see someone who looks like you
[03:47.20] And someday, after a year or two
[03:52.26] Maybe then I'll still be loving you
